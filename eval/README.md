# Evaluation Guide

The following section provides instructions for evaluating the **Janus-Pro** model on three compositional text-to-image benchmarks.</br>
> ⚠️ We only provide the image generation code; therefore, you should perform the evaluation using the original evaluation repository.

| DPGBench        |   [Github](https://github.com/TencentQQGYLab/ELLA) | _An expansive field, blanketed by the soft light of morning, cradles a collection of eight cabbages, their green heads round and plump. These vegetables are nestled among rows of rich soil, dotted with glistening droplets of dew that cling to their crinkled leaves. As wisps of mist begin to lift, the cabbages lie poised, ready for the day's impending harvest._ |
